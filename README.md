# CS 498 Machine Perception Project: Probabilistic Semantic Occupancy Prediction for Visual Navigation
This code is based on the official code for SemExp: https://devendrachaplot.github.io/projects/semantic-exploration
The key new files are:
* `collect.py`: for collecting map data in Habitat with a random agent.
* `pred_global.py`: for evaluating navigation performance of HPP in Habitat.
* `train.py`: for training PSOP model.
* `eval.py`: for evaluating PSOP model.
